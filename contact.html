                <div id="Answer-1" class="faq-info justify background_white">
                    <h4 class="no-margin">What is your return policy and warranty?</h4>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray sub">30 Day Performance Guarantee.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Right off the bat, we give you a full 30 days to try our products out — to make sure they fit correctly, match your personal style, and most importantly...sound amazing!</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">We are confident our products will meet and exceed customer expectations. If for whatever reason a customer isn’t satisfied, we offer a no-questions-asked refund within 30 days of purchase. U.S customers will get free return shipping. Customers outside the U.S. are required to pay for return shipping costs.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray sub">1 Year Warranty</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Status Audio is responsible for defects in materials and workmanship for one year after date of original purchase. If the defect is Status Audio's responsibility (e.g., sound is lost in one side of the headphones), the customer will be furnished with a replacement unit. User-inflicted damage is covered with a partial credit towards a replacement unit.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">After one year, all claims will be handled on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of Status Audio.</p>
                    <h4 class="no-margin">I’m not satisfied by the sound, fit, or style of the headphones. What are my options?</h4>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">If you are within 30 days of receiving your headphones, we offer a no-questions-asked return/refund.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Past 30 days, we can’t accept returns simply on the grounds of dissatisfaction with the product.</p>

                <div id="Answer-2" class="faq-info justify background_white">
                    <h4 class="no-margin">Are your products wireless?</h4>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">The BT One, BT Structure, and BT Transfer are our current wireless offerings. They support Bluetooth 5.0, the latest version of the most popular wireless audio standard.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Using this wireless standard makes Status products compatible with virtually every modern smartphone, tablet, computer, or television.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Check out our wireless lineup here.</p>
                    <h4 class="no-margin">What's the wireless range of Status Bluetooth products?</h4>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Bluetooth transmission distance can vary greatly depending on environment.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Typical range indoors is 10-20 meters, and the signal can pass through walls and floors.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Outdoors, the range can vary greatly - generally, heavily populated urban environments pose challenges to Bluetooth devices. So for ideal use, we suggest to keep your source device close by.</p>
                    <h4 class="no-margin">Can I connect a Status wireless product to multiple devices (aka "multi-point" pairing)?</h4>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Yes, Status wireless devices support multi-point pairing. You can connect two devices (say a phone + laptop) simultaneously.</p>

                <a id="Question-3" href="#Answer-3">UK/EU Shipping<span>&#711;</span></a>
                <div id="Answer-3" class="faq-info justify background_white">
                    <h4 class="no-margin">Do you ship to the UK and EU?</h4>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Yes! We ship to the United Kingdom and the entire European Union:</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden.</p>
                    <h4 class="no-margin">How long will it take a UK/EU order to arrive?</h4>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">All UK/EU shipments will be dispatched from our UK warehouse, which is located just outside of London.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Since UK shipments are dispatched locally, they can arrive as quickly as 2 days.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">EU delivery take a bit longer, and delivery times can vary - generally, 5-15 days. Customers will be given a delivery timeframe at checkout.</p>
                    <h4 class="no-margin">Are your prices VAT inclusive?</h4>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">No. VAT will be charged at checkout.</p>
                    <h4 class="no-margin">Will I be charged in my home currency?</h4>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">No. You will be charged in $USD - US dollars.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">For convenience, we can display pricing in €Euros or £GBP at the current exchange rate.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">You can select currency in the upper right corner of the screen.</p>

                <a id="Question-4" href="#Answer-4">US/Canada Shipping<span>&#711;</span></a>
                <div id="Answer-4" class="faq-info justify background_white">
                    <h4 class="no-margin">How long will my order take to arrive?</h4>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">U.S. customers have multiple shipping options available for both standard and expedited deliveries. Our standard shipping rate arrives between 2-5 days. We also offer expedited 2 day service.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">We utilize a variety of carriers (UPS, Fedex, UPS, etc.) to ensure a speedy and reliable delivery.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Canadian customers have a single standard shipping rate (5-10 days) available.</p>
                    <h4 class="no-margin">I haven’t received tracking information yet. What’s going on?</h4>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Don’t worry! Tracking information can take some time for the carrier to generate - expect about 24 - 48 hrs after placing your order for a tracking number to be sent your way.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">If you are well outside this time-frame, please shoot us a note using the contact form and we can sort it out for you.</p>
                    <h4 class="no-margin">My tracking information is showing a delivery, however I have not received my shipment.</h4>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">This happens quite often, so no need to worry. It is likely that your parcel is waiting for you at your local post office. The carrier may have attempted delivery and no one was home, or simply made a mistake.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Your best bet is to contact your local post office with your tracking information, and schedule a pick-up or re-delivery.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">If this doesn’t solve your problem, shoot us a note using the contact form and we can help you out.</p>

                    <h4 class="no-margin">My headband snapped. What are my options?</h4>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">We typically offer customers with snapped headband partial credit towards a replacement set. We consider this user-inflicted damage, although if you believe your headband snapped as a result of a defective product, we will certainly hear you out.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Regardless, please use the contact form below and we will provide a speedy resolution.</p>
                    <h4 class="no-margin">I'm having issues charging the battery of my Status wireless product. What's going on?</h4>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">First off, make sure you are using the provided charging cable. Aftermarket cables can sometimes have compatibility or quality issues.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">The product will show a red light when it is charging, and a blue light when it is fully charged.</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">If the product still isn't charging, or isn't meeting the battery longevity, please contact us using the form below and we will assist.</p>
                    <h4 class="no-margin">My BT Structure, BT Transfer, or IEM-2X earbuds sound "thin" or "tinny". What's going on here?</h4>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">It's likely you don't have a proper in-ear seal. An airtight seal is crucial to hearing the full frequency spectrum (especially those low notes).</p>
                    <p class="no-margin more-gray">Try sizing up ear-tips - so if you are using the medium ear-tip, try the large size. Please also note that the earbuds require full insertion in your ear canal.</p>
